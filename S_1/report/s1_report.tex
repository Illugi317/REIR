 \section{Introduction}
\explanation{State the objective(s) of the exercise. Ask yourself: Why did I perform the
  experiment? What did I aim to achieve? Provide background about the subject
  matter, as needed (what are union-find data structures good for?). Include
  the purpose of the different steps.
}
    The objective of the exercise is to find out if a N-by-N grid perculates, or better said, find the "magic" ratio between open and closed sites that makes the system perculate.
    We preformed the exercise to give us a better understanding of the problem at hand and understand how to utilize the different union-like structures.
    Our aim was to code the problem with different union like structures and then test it vigorously by using our Stats class.

    Percolation\\

    Perculation (Útskýra hvað í fokkanum perculation er - copya frá lýsingu ?)

  \subsection{Setup and Methods}
\explanation{ Describe how you performed the exercise. Write about what you actually did
  rather than what you were supposed to do. Be concise;  only give the
  necessary details a person in the same field needs to perform the exercise.
  Write in narrative form (i.e., telling a story) rather than a numbered list
  format. Describe both the set-up (hardware, OS, software, tools) and the testing
  process. Refer to the classes written.}
    We did the project on "macc details" using IntelliJ from jetbrains for java development and we used java11. We started on figuring out how we want to store all of the data and how we can do that efficiently!
    We started with a integer grid so we could get the row and col and get the value but a matrix if integers takes alot of memeory, so we settled on using a boolean matrix to keep track whether the site is open or not,
    but that created a problem, how are we going to find the index for the union data structure? Simple! We devised a plan! Since we know that it's a N-by-N grid then we can calculate the index for the data structure,
    the formula is as such:
    \begin{equation}
        index = (row * N) + col 
    \end{equation}
    After we found that out we started programming, we then figured out that we need to find an efficient way to store pairs of row number and column number, we created a private Pair class within the Perculation class,
    The pair class is as simple as it gets, it stores the row number and the column number.\\

    When we finished that we went about of writing the open function, the open function simply opens the site and then checks if any other neighbouring cells are open, if so we connect them to the union data structure. But how are we going to find the neighbours ?
    By writing methods! Private methods to be exact, We wrote a method that gets the neighbouring cells row number and column number and then we wrote another private method that checks if the row numbers and column numbers are valid within the N-by-N matrix the system is in.

Give a formula (using tilde notation) for the running time (in seconds) of 
\texttt{PercolationStats.java} as a function of both $N$ and $T$. Be sure to give both 
the coefficient and exponent of the leading term. Your coefficients should 
be based on empirical data and rounded to two significant digits, such as 
$5.3 \cdot 10^{-8} \cdot N^{5.0} T^{1.5}$.}
